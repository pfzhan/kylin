### Release History

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.6 release note

**Feature**

- Read/Write Separation Deployment
- Update license in Web UI
- Apply for license by self-service in Marketplace

**Enhancement**

- Support to view Spark execution details after executing SQL query
- Support intersect count function in expert mode
- Optimize the building performance if the fact table is a view and contains the count distinct measure
- Support using table index to answers some aggregate queries
- The select * query can return computed columns when there are computed columns saved in the model

**Bugfix**

- After restarting the job, the job log output is not updated in time in the job monitor page. It is still displayed as the log of the previous execution

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.5 release note

**Feature**

- Expert mode supports recommendation mode, which provides recommendations for existing models by analyzing the query history and model usage.
- Provide different user roles to meet different levels of operation permissions
- Provide health check API to check node status in cluster deployment

**Enhancement**

- Support to accelerate queries with count(constant) or count(distinct constant)
- Support to input 'database.table' when loading source tables
- Support to set the default database at project level
- Enable Tomcat compression configuration by default to reduce the query results and network transmission time when integrating with a BI tool

**Bugfix**

- The index building job fails if it contains a count distinct measure and the source table is empty.
- Pushdown query fails if there are same expressions in select clause.
- Incremental loading job fails, when the partition column contains empty value.
- Merging job may fail in resource detection steps if there are too many segments

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.4 release note

**Feature**

- Support cell level data access control

**Enhancement**

- Support exporting query results to a CSV file
- Support system admin user to view all job information across all projects in the job monitor page
- Support some new query functions
- Optimize the recognition and conversion of computed columns in smart mode project
- Support searching database.table in data source loading page
- Provide model/index group expansion rate

**Bugfix**

- Project information has not been updated after switching to other projects in the model editing page.
- In expert mode, computed columns are unavailable to use when defining table index

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.3 release note

**Enhancement**

- Support automatic upgrade via script
- Enhance diagnostic package
- Support some new query functions
- Optimize the recognition and conversion of computed columns in smart mode project
- Simplify integration with Kerberos
- Optimize the build performance of Count Distinct measure

**Bugfix**

- Queries still hit the cache when the model goes offline
- In smart mode, when the type of measure is int or boolean, query pushdown in Power BI will return error
- In smart mode, when querying the recommended computed column through Power BI, query pushdown will return error
- Timestamp() function cannot support millisecond precision

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.2 release note

**Feature**

- Support integration with LDAP
- Support integration with 3rd-party User Authentication System
- Support HTTPS connection

**Enhancement**

- Support to view partial job execution log and download the full logs on monitor page
- Support some new query functions
- Improve the query performance when queries contain the join condition with a high cardinality column
- Support dynamic resource allocation in table sampling job
- Optimize the recognition and conversion of computed columns in smart mode project

**Bugfix**

- The password reset script for ADMIN user doesnâ€™t take effect

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.0.1 release note
