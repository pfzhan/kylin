#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.5.0 release note
In this new version, Kyligence Enterprise not only supports real-time data analysis, but also supports fusion analysis of historical data and real-time data under a unified model and query portal. Under the broadening of the analysis scenario, the simple architecture reduces the operation and maintenance cost. At the same time, the introduction of Smart Tiered Storage functions can support flexible ad hoc query scenarios with random combinations of multiple dimensions, bringing users more possibilities for analysis and exploration based on massive data. In addition, Spark, which is the core component of Kyligence Enterprise has been greatly upgraded, which greatly improves the stability of building and query; Kyligence Enterprise supports the automatic creation and maintenance of base indexes, which increases the model's coverage of queries. 
**Smart Tiered Storage**
Kyligence Enterprise provides HDFS/Object Storage and Clickhouse serve as two tiers of storage, significantly improving the performance of ad-hoc analytics and detailed query by providing the Smart Tiered Storage capability with ClickHouse. With pre-calculation and AI augmented engine, it can cover more analysis scenarios, and help Enterprise to operate in a refined approach and support business decision making.
With Smart Tiered Storage, business users can still consume the Unified Semantic Layer using their preferred tool without the need of knowing the underlying computation and storage mechanism, which will significantly reduce the labor and time cost in the model, and obtain a unified analysis experience. 
**Kyligence Real-time**
The real-time nature of data analysis determines the timeliness of business decision-making. Taking immediate action at the first moment of an incident is a key factor in the success of business operations especially in use cases such as fraud detection, campaign monitoring. 
Kyligence Enterprise 4.5 helps businesses such as marketing, risk management who want to do real-time data monitoring or hybrid analysis of historical data and nowadays data by offering a minute-level latency real-time query engine using Spark structured streaming under the same Unified Semantic Model and query entrance. 
Unlike most of the alternative solutions available in the market, Kyligence provides one platform to serve online, offline, and hybrid analysis, so it hides the differences in the underlying data and achieves simplified and unified analysis for business. 
In contrast to a separate architecture for batch and real-time data, a hybrid architecture means reduced complexity in architecture, shortened development cycle, and lower operation and maintenance cost for IT.
**Upgrade of Spark version**
In Kyligence Enterprise 4.5, the core component Spark is upgraded to Spark 3, which supports multiple important new features, and users can use upper-layer functions without paying attention to the underlying details. In data skewed scenarios, the existence of skewed partitions may cause performance bottlenecks in the building task. 
Adaptive Query Execution (AQE) capability improves building stability and query efficiency by adaptively repartitioning skewed data. The dynamic partition pruning (DPP) capability can perform partition pruning based on the information obtained during query runtime to improve query performance. In addition, Spark 3 also fixes more than 3400 patches compared to the lower version of Spark, eliminating the manpower investment in developing a large number of patches. 
Most importantly, Spark 3 will be a stepping stone for Kyligence to get Kubernized and provide a private-cloud deployment offering in the future. 
**Base Index**
If the query pushdown is not allowed in the enterprise, queries that cannot be answered by Kyligence Enterprise will fail. At this time, increasing the query response rate of the platform can ensure service stability to a greater extent. In Kyligence Enterprise 4.5, the base indexes are automatically generated when the model is generated, including all the dimensions and measures in the model. As long as the time range of queries match that of the built indexes, the query that hits the model can hit the basic indexes. And the base indexes support automatic update as the model changes, reducing manual maintenance costs. For more details, please refer to the user manual.

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.3.0 release note
Kyligence Enterprise 4.3 provides detailed and efficient data management functionalities.  The introduction of Multi-level Partitioning provides business the ability to process data from different regions at different time. Snapshot Management enables users to control and utilize resources better. 

Resource Group is designed to enable business units to isolate data access, build and query requests. Model Migration supports the incremental update of a data model.  Asynchronous Query allows users to export large data set efficiently. 

Kyligence Enterprise 4.3 is fully integrated with Tableau. Export TDS makes it easierier for users to synchronize data model to Tableau.  There’s no repetitive modeling across Kyligence and Tableua anymore .  Fast Visualization have achieved new levels of speed for business to visulize the query results.

Detailed and Efficient Data Management
Multi-level Partitioning

For business that operates across regions, the time to update data can be different. Kyligence Enterprise supports up to 2 level partition on demand for independent data analysis by region/defined BUs. Data can be loaded and managed based on time zones and regions separately.

Snapshot Management

When the size of the dimension table is increased, Kyligence Enterprise supports the building of new snapshots on demand to improve the efficiency of model building. When the source table is a partitioned table, incremental update of the partition snapshots is also supported to reduce the time needed to build large-dimensional tables.

Enterprise-level Capability Improvements
Resource Group

Kyligence Enterprise provides business the flexibility to isolate or share resource groups​. Thus improves stability​.  The innovative design of this feature allows business to operate independently yet to share resource group and improve the utlization of resources.  Based on different user scenario, it is flexible for exclusive or shared resource groups by project​.

Model Migration

Model migration is improved to support the incremental update of model.  This feature ensures the model consistancy when migrating to different environments, backing up for disaster recovery and version control.  Model is exported as metadata file.  The UI based or open APIs make the migration smooth and easy. 

Asynchronous Query

Asynchronous execution of SQL queries provide a more efficient way to export data. When the result set of the query is too large or the query execution takes too long, the asynchronous query can efficiently export the query result set, helping to expand various application scenarios such as self-service data fetching.

User Experience Optimization
Export TDS

Models can be exported as a TDS file. After importing into Tableau, user can directly synchronize the tables, association relationships, dimensional measures, and other information in the model.  This easy to use feature reduces repetitive modeling work in data analysis,  and improve analysis efficiency.

Fast Visualization 

When the query result is displayed in a table, the information display is direct but not intuitive, and fast insight cannot be achieved. Kyligence Enterprise provides fast visualization of query results where users can view query results in intuitive way and discover valuable data faster.

#### Kyligence Enterprise 4.2.0 release note

In this new release, Kyligence Enterprise supports **flexible index building**, which enables queries from business could get more faster response.

At the same time, a new **data volume statistics system** is added, which is convenient and flexible for users to monitor the usage in project and table level, and we support **slowly changing dimension type 2**, which helps to cover more comprehensive business scenario.

In addition, the existing **index management mechanism** has also been optimized and improved, allowing the AI augmented engine to provide better OLAP modeling, analysis and management assistance.

**Flexible Index Building**

A more flexible index building mode is provided, that is, selected indexes could be built into a specified segment. In most usage scenarios, while the building cost is reduced, the indexes could respond faster to the query needs of business. What's more, the maintenance and management costs of automated scheduling will be reduced as well.

**Data Volume Statistics System**

The data volume statistics system will provide data volume statistics on different levels, and historical data volume usage trends can also be viewed. While the platform manager could get and statistical data usage conveniently and swiftly, the system also satisfies the flexible management and control requirements of enterprise users on the use of resources.

**Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2**

The new version Kyligence Enterprise supports slowly changing dimensions (Type 2) based on self-maintaining history table, so the system could flexibly respond to the analysis requirements of slow changing dimensions in business. Based on reasonable models, Kyligence can support a wider range of business scenarios.
