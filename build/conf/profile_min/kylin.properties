# KAP provides two configuration profiles: minimal and production(by default).
# To switch to production:
# cd $KYLIN_HOME/conf
# ln -sfn profile_prod profile
# To switch to minimal(for sandbox test):
# ln -sfn profile_min profile



# minimal profile is same as prod, except for some conservative resource allocation behaviors
