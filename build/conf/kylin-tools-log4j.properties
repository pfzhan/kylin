# the kylin-tools-log4j.properties is mainly for configuring log properties on kylin tools, including:
#   1. tools launched by kylin.sh script, e.g. DeployCoprocessorCLI
#   2. DebugTomcat
#   3. others
# 
# It's called kylin-tools-log4j.properties so that it won't distract users from the other more important log4j config file: kylin-server-log4j.properties  
# enable this by -Dlog4j.configuration=kylin-tools-log4j.properties
