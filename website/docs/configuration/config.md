| kylin.metadata.url                                           | Kylin metadata path is specified by this property. The default value is `kylin_metadata` table in PostgreSQL while users can customize it to store metadata into any other table. When deploying multiple Kylin instances on a cluster, it's necessary to specify a unique path for each of them to guarantee the isolation among them. For example, the value of this property for Production instance could be `kylin_metadata_prod`, while that for staging instance could be `kylin_metadata_staging`, so that Production instance wouldn't be interfered by operations on staging instance.                                       |

| kylin.query.force-limit                                      | Some BI tools always send query like `select * from fact_table`, but the process may stuck if the table size is extremely large. `LIMIT` clause helps in this case, and setting the value of this property to a positive integer make Kylin append `LIMIT` clause if there's no one. For instance the value is `1000`, query `select * from fact_table` will be transformed to `select * from fact_table limit 1000`.

For example: Assume there are three tables A, B, and C . By default, the SQL `A inner join B` can only be answered by the model of A inner join B or the model of A inner join B left join C. The model of A inner join B inner join C cannot answer it. If this parameter is set to `true`, the SQL of A inner join B can be answered with the model of A inner join B or A inner join B left join C, or it can also be answered with the model of A inner join B inner join C. |

If the config is set to `true`, the query is allowed to contain only part of the non-equi joins. e.g. model: A left join B non-equi left join C. When the config is set to `false`, only query with the complete join relations of the model can be matched with the model. When the config is set to `true`, query like A left join B can also be matched with the model.                                                                                |

### Modifying Kylin Properties

To override default configurations, create a `kylin.properties.override` file in the `$KYLIN_HOME/conf` directory. This file allows you to customize settings at runtime.

**Best Practice:** During system upgrades, retain the `kylin.properties.override` file with the new `kylin.properties` version to ensure a seamless transition.

**Important Note:** Parameters defined in `kylin.properties` or `kylin.properties.override` are global and loaded by default when Kylin starts. After modifying these files, restart Kylin for the changes to take effect.


### Modifying JVM Settings

In the `$KYLIN_HOME/conf/setenv.sh.template` file, you'll find a sample setting for the `KYLIN_JVM_SETTINGS` environment variable. This default setting uses relatively little memory, but you can adjust it according to your own environment. The default JVM configuration is as follows:

```properties
export KYLIN_JVM_SETTINGS="-server -Xms1g -Xmx8g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16m -XX:+PrintFlagsFinal -XX:+PrintReferenceGC -verbose:gc -XX:+PrintGCDetails -XX:+PrintGCTimeStamps -XX:+PrintGCDateStamps -XX:+PrintAdaptiveSizePolicy -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+G1SummarizeConcMark  -Xloggc:$KYLIN_HOME/logs/kylin.gc.$$  -XX:+UseGCLogFileRotation -XX:NumberOfGCLogFiles=10 -XX:GCLogFileSize=64M -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=${KYLIN_HOME}/logs"
```

If you want to modify this configuration, you need to create a copy of the template file, name it `setenv.sh`, and place it in the `$KYLIN_HOME/conf/` directory. You can then modify the configuration in the new file as needed. 

The parameter `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=${KYLIN_HOME}/logs` generates logs when an `OutOfMemory` error occurs. The default log file path is `${KYLIN_HOME}/logs`, but you can modify it if required.
```bash
export JAVA_VM_XMS=1g        #The initial memory of the JVM when kylin starts.
export JAVA_VM_XMX=8g        #The maximum memory of the JVM when kylin starts.
export JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMS=1g   #The initial memory of the JVM when the tool class is started.
export JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMX=8g   #The maximum memory of the JVM when the tool class is started.
```

The `JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMS` and `JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMX` environment variables control the initial and maximum memory of the JVM when running tool classes. If these variables are not set, they will default to the values of `JAVA_VM_XMS` and `JAVA_VM_XMX`, respectively.

Please note that some special tool classes, such as `guardian.sh`, `check-2100-hive-acl.sh`, and `get-properties.sh`, are not affected by these configurations. To take advantage of these new configurations, you need to manually set the `JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMS` and `JAVA_VM_TOOL_XMX` variables when upgrading from an older version.


### Modifying Spark Configurations

Kylin relies heavily on Apache Spark for both query and job building. To customize Spark configurations, use the following prefixes:

* `kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf` for queries
* `kylin.engine.spark-conf` for builds

These prefixes can be used to customize various Spark settings, such as memory allocation, execution parameters, and more. For a detailed explanation of Spark configuration, please refer to the official documentation: [Spark Configuration](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/configuration.html).

**1. Query-Related Configurations**

```shell
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.executor.instances
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.executor.cores
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.executor.memory
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.executor.memoryOverhead
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.sql.shuffle.partitions
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.driver.memory
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.driver.memoryOverhead
kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.driver.cores
```

**2. Job Building-Related Configurations**

```shell
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.executor.instances
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.executor.cores
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.executor.memory
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.executor.memoryOverhead
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.sql.shuffle.partitions
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.driver.memory
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.driver.memoryOverhead
kylin.engine.spark-conf.spark.driver.cores
```

**3. Switching to Minimal Configurations**

Under **$KYLIN_HOME/conf/**, there are two sets of configurations ready for use: `production` and `minimal`. The former is the default configuration, recommended for production environments. The latter uses minimal resources, suitable for sandbox or single-node environments with limited resources. To switch to `minimal` configurations, please uncomment the following configuration items in `$KYLIN_HOME/conf/kylin.properties` and restart Kylin to take effect:
```shell
# Kylin provides two configuration profiles: minimal and production(by default).
# To switch to minimal: uncomment the properties
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.driver.memory=512m
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.executor.memory=512m
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.executor.memoryOverhead=512m
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.executor.extraJavaOptions=-Dhdp.version=current -Dlog4j.configurationFile=spark-executor-log4j.xml -Dlog4j.debug -Dkylin.hdfs.working.dir=${kylin.env.hdfs-working-dir} -Dkap.metadata.identifier=${kylin.metadata.url.identifier} -Dkap.spark.category=sparder -Dkap.spark.project=${job.project} -XX:MaxDirectMemorySize=512M
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.yarn.am.memory=512m
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.executor.cores=1
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.executor.instances=1
#kylin.storage.columnar.spark-conf.spark.sql.adaptive.coalescePartitions.minPartitionNum=1
```

### Sparder Canary Overview

Sparder Canary is a health monitoring component for the Sparder application, which is the Spark engine used for querying in Kylin. It periodically checks the status of the running Sparder instance and automatically initiates the creation of a new instance if any abnormalities are detected, such as unexpected termination or loss of responsiveness. This ensures that the Sparder application remains in a healthy and functional state at all times.
